// I am not sure at this point if I want two objects for the rovers or I will just use one. I would really like Spirit and Opportunity to extend Rover :(

// private stuff x, y orientation

// How can the rover know where is the other rover, hm. The plateau should maybe handle that. Plateau knows where is the other rover?
// pf move()
// $this->plateau->canGo(new position) ? That looks tricky. I am going to go for it but I have doubts.
